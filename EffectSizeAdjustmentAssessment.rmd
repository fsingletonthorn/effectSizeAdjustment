# REMEMBER TO COUNT ALL OF THE ARTICLES INCLUDED FROM EACH SOURCE - all for which Rs could be calculated or extracted from original and replication studies

## Methods 

When sample sizes for original studies were not avaliable they were manually extracted from original articles (for: many labs 3). Effect size statistics such as F values with a df1 of > 1, and Ï‡2 values have been converted to correlations and Cohen's d values, but their standard errors cannot be computed directly. These studies have been excluded from the meta-analyses.

Sample sizes were assumed to be equal in all groups. 

Original p values and replication p values presented here were re-calculated using the Fisher Transformed z score.
