# REMEMBER TO COUNT ALL OF THE ARTICLES INCLUDED FROM EACH SOURCE - all for which Rs could be calculated or extracted from original and replication studies

## Methods 

When sample sizes for original studies were not avaliable they were manually extracted from original articles (for: many labs 3). Effect size statistics such as F values with a df1 of > 1, and χ2 values have been converted to correlations and Cohen's d values, but their standard errors cannot be computed directly. These studies have been excluded from the meta-analyses.

Sample sizes were assumed to be equal in all groups. 

Original p values and replication p values presented here were re-calculated using the Fisher Transformed z score.


For nature science reporducibility papers, when multiple replciation studies were run, a fixed effects meta-analysis was performed using the metafor package for each study to estimate the effect. P values, standard errors and ns reflect this pooled estiamte. This method lead to one study more "replicating" according to the 'statistical significance in the same direction of the original study' using the largest perfored study criteria that the original authors reported. 

# I COULD GO THROUGH AN RECALCULATE P VALUES FOR ALL THOSE WITH VALID SEs at the end



TRY SMALL TELESCOPES, lower bound of 95% CIs, other methods of adjustment I.e., (Anderson et al., 2017; McShane & Böckenholt, 2016; Perugini et al., 2014; and Taylor & Muller, 1996). Maybe look into some of the meta-analytic methods?
